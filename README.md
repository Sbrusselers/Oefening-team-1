# Oefening

**Objective**: Engage in a collaborative data analysis project using Databricks notebooks, integrated with GitHub for version control and team collaboration.

**Project Case:
**Perform a simple data analysis task using a Python notebook in Databricks, such as analyzing a publicly available dataset and creating basic visualizations.

Preparation
Split into teams of 3-4. Assign roles:

**Release Manager**: 
Manages the GitHub repository, reviews, and merges pull requests.
Developer 1, 2, and 3: Each has specific tasks in the development of the notebook.
Ensure all team members have access to Databricks and understand the basics of using notebooks in Databricks.

**Create a GitHub repository**:

The Release Manager creates a new public repository on GitHub, named DataAnalysisProject.
Add a README.md file with a brief project description: "A collaborative data analysis project using Databricks and Python."
**Exercise Steps**

**1. Release Manager:**
Add all team members as collaborators to the GitHub repository.
In Databricks, link the workspace to the DataAnalysisProject repository (via Repos).
**2. All Developers:**

Accept the repository collaboration invitation.
Clone the DataAnalysisProject repository in their Databricks workspace.

**3. Developer 1 (Data Loading and Preparation):**
In Databricks, create a new branch named data-setup.
Create a new notebook in this branch named Data_Setup.
Write Python code to load a dataset (e.g., using Pandas to load a CSV file from a public URL).
Include basic data preparation steps (e.g., handling missing values, basic filtering).
Commit and push the notebook to the data-setup branch using Databricks' Git features.
On GitHub, open a pull request to merge data-setup into the main branch.

**4. Developer 2 (Data Analysis):**
Wait for the data-setup branch to be merged by the Release Manager.
Create a new branch from main, named data-analysis.
Create or continue the notebook, now named Data_Analysis.
Perform basic data analysis, such as computing summary statistics or generating simple plots.
Commit and push these changes to the data-analysis branch.
On GitHub, open a pull request to merge data-analysis into the main branch.
**5. Developer 3 (Documentation and Insights):**

Wait for the data-analysis branch to be merged by the Release Manager.
Create a new branch from main, named documentation.
Update the README.md file with detailed project insights and how to run the analysis.
Optionally, add additional comments or markdown cells in the Data_Analysis notebook to explain the analysis steps.
Commit and push these changes to the documentation branch.
On GitHub, open a pull request to merge documentation into the main branch.

**6. Release Manager:**
Sequentially review and merge pull requests: first data-setup, then data-analysis, and finally documentation.
Ensure the changes are correctly integrated and resolve any merge conflicts if they arise.

**Important Notes:**
Developers should regularly communicate and coordinate, especially if one task depends on the completion of another.
Itâ€™s important to wait for the necessary branches to be merged before proceeding with dependent tasks to avoid merge conflicts and ensure data consistency.
